# Deathbattle 
V1 - Version 1

## Information
This is an Deathbattle system that allows users to "fight" each other using bot narrated events
Each attack/event can be customized, removed, added, etc.
Each attack does a specfic amount of damage  
This command also allows you to restore the default actionPossibilities.json file which is the file that manages all possible acitons/events that happen in a battle

Remember to drag the components in the resources folder to the bot resource folder!
Do not drag the resources folder itself but the things inside it

## Commands
- deathbattle [@player] || deathbattle [@player] [@player]
- deathbsettings list || info || add || remove || restore

## Events
- deathBattleCheck - Check all files that are needed for the commands to work properly and if the check fails it will disable all deathbattle commands

## Warning
These commands were all tested inside the windows command line and not ran within DBM
Do NOT run this command while running the bot form DBM unless you risk an required re-installation of Jimp
