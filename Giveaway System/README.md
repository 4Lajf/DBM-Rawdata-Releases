# Giveaway System

## Version
Version 1 - Release

## Information
This is new giveaway system with the latest await response
There is only 1 command, and that is to setup the giveaway
It will loop you through prompts that ask you for information and it'll setup the giveaway for you
You will respond with the information it asks you

First, I'll ask for you what you are giving away
Secondly, I'll ask you for how many winners you want (As many as you want)
Then, I'll ask you for how long the giveaway will last in days/hours/minutes [1d,5m,3h, etc.]
After that, I'll ask you for what channel you want the giveaway to be hosted in

There is a failsafe along the setup to make sure you did it correctly
Make sure you use this command in a chat where there are little to no chatting at all

The command will "timeout" after 20 messages that are sent in the channel or 20 seconds to prevent any API spam and issues seeing the prompt itself

You need the **Manage Messages** permission to use the gcreate command unless changed

If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me or open an issue on this github
Also, please do not contact me for a giveaway end command, I am looking into it already
