# Deathbattle 
Version 1 - Release

## Information
This is an easy and quick Text to Speech command  
This command takes user text input and then generates an speech mp3 file  
This is done under the raw data quest of Toepas#6190  

This command generates an MP3 file locally and sends it  
Right after it sends it, it'll delete it off the local drive to not clutter anything up  

## Commands

This for the free version of the google text to speech api of course
